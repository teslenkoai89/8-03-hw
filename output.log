# The bind.keys file is used to override the built-in DNSSEC trust anchors
# which are included as part of BIND 9.  The only trust anchors it contains
# are for the DNS root zone (".").  Trust anchors for any other zones MUST
# be configured elsewhere; if they are configured here, they will not be
# recognized or used by named.
#
# To use the built-in root key, set "dnssec-validation auto;" in the
# named.conf options, or else leave "dnssec-validation" unset.  If
# "dnssec-validation" is set to "yes", then the keys in this file are
# ignored; keys will need to be explicitly configured in named.conf for
# validation to work.  "auto" is the default setting, unless named is
# built with "configure --disable-auto-validation", in which case the
# default is "yes".
#
# This file is NOT expected to be user-configured.
#
# Servers being set up for the first time can use the contents of this file
# as initializing keys; thereafter, the keys in the managed key database
# will be trusted and maintained automatically.
#
# These keys are current as of November 2024.  If any key fails to
# initialize correctly, it may have expired. This should not occur if
# BIND is kept up to date.
#
# See https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml for current trust
# anchor information for the root zone.

# Configuration for getaddrinfo(3).
#
# So far only configuration for the destination address sorting is needed.
# RFC 3484 governs the sorting.  But the RFC also says that system
# administrators should be able to overwrite the defaults.  This can be
# achieved here.
#
# All lines have an initial identifier specifying the option followed by
# up to two values.  Information specified in this file replaces the
# default information.  Complete absence of data of one kind causes the
# appropriate default information to be used.  The supported commands include:
#
# reload  <yes|no>
#    If set to yes, each getaddrinfo(3) call will check whether this file
#    changed and if necessary reload.  This option should not really be
#    used.  There are possible runtime problems.  The default is no.
#
# label   <mask>   <value>
#    Add another rule to the RFC 3484 label table.  See section 2.1 in
#    RFC 3484.  The default is:
#
#label ::1/128       0
#label ::/0          1
#label 2002::/16     2
#label ::/96         3
#label ::ffff:0:0/96 4
#label fec0::/10     5
#label fc00::/7      6
#label 2001:0::/32   7
#
#    This default differs from the tables given in RFC 3484 by handling
#    (now obsolete) site-local IPv6 addresses and Unique Local Addresses.
#    The reason for this difference is that these addresses are never
#    NATed while IPv4 site-local addresses most probably are.  Given
#    the precedence of IPv6 over IPv4 (see below) on machines having only
#    site-local IPv4 and IPv6 addresses a lookup for a global address would
#    see the IPv6 be preferred.  The result is a long delay because the
#    site-local IPv6 addresses cannot be used while the IPv4 address is
#    (at least for the foreseeable future) NATed.  We also treat Teredo
#    tunnels special.
#
# precedence  <mask>   <value>
#    Add another rule to the RFC 3484 precedence table.  See section 2.1
#    and 10.3 in RFC 3484.  The default is:
#
#precedence  ::1/128       50
#precedence  ::/0          40
#precedence  2002::/16     30
#precedence ::/96          20
#precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10
#
#    For sites which prefer IPv4 connections change the last line to
#
#precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  100

#
# scopev4  <mask>  <value>
#    Add another rule to the RFC 6724 scope table for IPv4 addresses.
#    By default the scope IDs described in section 3.2 in RFC 6724 are
#    used.  Changing these defaults should hardly ever be necessary.
#    The defaults are equivalent to:
#
#scopev4 ::ffff:169.254.0.0/112  2
#scopev4 ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104    2
#scopev4 ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96       14
# Configuration file for the color grep utility

# 'none' shuts colorization off.
#COLOR none

# Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight various parts
# of the output.  See frep(1) for details.

# hosts.allow	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#		allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#		by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#

#
# hosts.deny	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#		*not* allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#		by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#
# The portmap line is redundant, but it is left to remind you that
# the new secure portmap uses hosts.deny and hosts.allow.  In particular
# you should know that NFS uses portmap!

This is the file .../info/dir, which contains the
topmost node of the Info hierarchy, called (dir)Top.
The first time you invoke Info you start off looking at this node.

File: dir,	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree

  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.
  Typing "q" exits, "H" lists all Info commands, "d" returns here,
  "h" gives a primer for first-timers,
  "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs manual, etc.

  In Emacs, you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item or cross reference
  to select it.

## Proxy can help to pass a firewall
## Environment variables ftp_proxy, http_proxy and no_proxy are used to
## initialize the below variables automatically. You can set them here too.
##
## ftp:proxy must communicate with client over ftp protocol, squid won't do.
## This can be e.g. TIS-FWTK or rftpd. User and password are optional.
# set ftp:proxy ftp://[user:pass@]your_ftp_proxy:port
## ...but squid still can be used to access ftp servers, using hftp protocol:
# set ftp:proxy http://your.squid.address:port
## ...if squid allows CONNECT to arbitrary ports, then you can use CONNECT
## instead of hftp:
# set ftp:use-hftp no
##
## no proxy for host
# set ftp:proxy/local_host ""
## or domain
# set ftp:proxy/*.domain.com ...
##
## http:proxy must communicate with client over http protocol, e.g. squid.
## Default port is 3128.
# set http:proxy your_http_proxy[:port]
## hftp:proxy must also be an http proxy. It is used for FTP over HTTP access.
# set hftp:proxy your_http_proxy[:port]
##
## net:no-proxy disables proxy usage for list of domains.
# set net:no-proxy .domain.com,.otherdom.net

## If you don't have direct ftp access, this setting can be useful to select
## hftp instead of ftp automatically.
# set ftp:proxy http://your.http.proxy:port

## This can be used for automatic saving of configuration
# set at-exit "set > ~/.lftp/settings"
# source ~/.lftp/settings

## and this is for remembring last site
## (combine with previous rule if you want)
# set at-exit "bo a last"
# open last

## Terminal strings to set titlebars for terminals that don't
## properly specify tsl and fsl capabilities.
## Use cmd:set-term-status to enable this.
set cmd:term-status/*screen* "\e_\T\e\\"
set cmd:term-status/*xterm* "\e[11;0]\e]2;\T\007\e[11]"
set cmd:term-status/*rxvt* "\e[11;0]\e]2;\T\007\e[11]"
# set cmd:set-term-status on

## If you don't like advertising lftp or servers hate it, set this:
# set ftp:anon-pass "mozilla@"
# set ftp:client ""
# set http:user-agent "Mozilla/4.7 [en] (WinNT; I)"
# This is the configuration file for libaudit tunables.

# This file is used by the man-db package to configure the man and cat paths.
# It is also used to provide a manpath for those without one by examining
# their PATH environment variable. For details see the manpath(5) man page.
#
# Lines beginning with `#' are comments and are ignored. Any combination of
# tabs or spaces may be used as `whitespace' separators.
#
# There are three mappings allowed in this file:
# --------------------------------------------------------
# MANDATORY_MANPATH			manpath_element
# MANPATH_MAP		path_element	manpath_element
# MANDB_MAP		global_manpath	[relative_catpath]

# For a manpath element to be treated as a system manpath (as most of those
# above should normally be), it must be mentioned below. Each line may have
# an optional extra string indicating the catpath associated with the
# manpath. If no catpath string is used, the catpath will default to the
# given manpath.
#
# You *must* provide all system manpaths, including manpaths for alternate
# operating systems, locale specific manpaths, and combinations of both, if
# they exist, otherwise the permissions of the user running man/mandb will
# be used to manipulate the manual pages. Also, mandb will not initialise
# the database cache for any manpaths not mentioned below unless explicitly
# requested to do so.
#
# In a per-user configuration file, this directive only controls the
# location of catpaths and the creation of database caches; it has no effect
# on privileges.
#
# Any manpaths that are subdirectories of other manpaths must be mentioned
# *before* the containing manpath. E.g. /usr/man/preformat must be listed
# before /usr/man.

## === Syntax coloring ===
## For all details, see 'man nanorc', section SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING.

## To include most of the existing syntax definitions, you can do:
include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"

## Or you can select just the ones you need.  For example:
include "/usr/share/nano/html.nanorc"
include "/usr/share/nano/python.nanorc"
include "/usr/share/nano/sh.nanorc"

## In /usr/share/nano/extra/ you can find some syntaxes that are
## specific for certain distros or for some less common languages.


## If <Tab> should always produce four spaces when editing a Python file,
## independent of the settings of 'tabsize' and 'tabstospaces':
# extendsyntax python tabgives "    "


## === Key bindings ===
## For all details, see 'man nanorc', section REBINDING KEYS.

## If you want to suspend nano with one keystroke (instead of with ^T^Z):
# bind ^Z suspend main

## The <Ctrl+Delete> keystroke deletes the word to the right of the cursor.
## On some terminals the <Ctrl+Backspace> keystroke produces ^H, which is
## the ASCII character for backspace, so it is bound by default to the
## backspace function.  The <Backspace> key itself produces a different
## keycode, which is hard-bound to the backspace function.  So, if you
## normally use <Backspace> for backspacing and not ^H, you can make
## <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word to the left of the cursor with:
# bind ^H chopwordleft main

## For a more mnemonic Comment keystroke (overriding Cut-from-cursor):
# bind M-K comment main

## If you want ^L to just refresh the screen and not center the cursor:
# bind ^L refresh main

## When you sometimes type M-J instead of M-K, or M-T instead of M-R:
# unbind M-J main
# unbind M-T main
## (Those functions are still accessible through ^T^J and ^T^V.)

## For quickly uppercasing or lowercasing the word under or after the cursor.
## (These effectively select a word and pipe it through a sed command.)
# bind Sh-M-U "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\U&/'{enter}" main
# bind Sh-M-L "{nextword}{mark}{prevword}{execute}|sed 's/.*/\L&/'{enter}" main

## For copying a marked region to the system clipboard:
# bind Sh-M-C "{execute}|xsel -ib{enter}{undo}" main

## For normalizing Unicode to precomposed characters:
# bind Sh-M-N "{execute}| uconv -x nfc {enter}" main

## For snipping trailing blanks when you save a file:
# bind ^S "{execute}| sed 's/\s\+$//' {enter}{savefile}" main

## If you would like nano to have keybindings that are more "usual",
## such as ^O for Open, ^F for Find, ^H for Help, and ^Q for Quit,
## then uncomment these:
# bind ^X cut main
# bind ^C copy main
# bind ^V paste all
# bind ^Q exit all
# bind ^S savefile main
# bind ^W writeout main
# bind ^O insert main
# set multibuffer
# bind ^H help all
# bind ^H exit help
# bind ^F whereis all
# bind ^G findnext all
# bind ^B wherewas all
# bind ^D findprevious all
# bind ^R replace main
# unbind ^U all
# unbind ^N main
# unbind ^Y all
# unbind M-J main
# unbind M-T main
# bind ^A mark main
# bind ^P location main
# bind ^T gotoline main
# bind ^T gotodir browser
# bind ^T cutrestoffile execute
# bind ^L linter execute
# bind ^E execute main
# bind ^K "{mark}{end}{zap}" main
# bind ^U "{mark}{home}{zap}" main
# bind ^Z undo main
# bind ^Y redo main

# libsensors configuration file
# -----------------------------
#
# This default configuration file only includes statements which do not
# differ from one mainboard to the next. Only label, compute and set
# statements for internal voltage and temperature sensors are included.
#
# In general, local changes should not be added to this file, but rather
# placed in custom configuration files located in /etc/sensors.d. This
# approach makes further updates much easier.
#
# Such custom configuration files for specific mainboards can be found in
# "configs" directory of lm-sensors package.
#
# Please contribute back a configuration of your board so other users with
# the same hardware won't need to recreate it again and again.

# REGISTERED PORT NUMBERS
#
# The Registered Ports are listed by the IANA and on most systems can be
# used by ordinary user processes or programs executed by ordinary
# users.
#
# Ports are used in the TCP [RFC793] to name the ends of logical
# connections which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of
# providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is
# defined.  This list specifies the port used by the server process as
# its contact port.
#
# The IANA registers uses of these ports as a convenience to the
# community.

# Sample configuration file for smartd.  See man smartd.conf.

# Home page is: https://www.smartmontools.org

# smartd will re-read the configuration file if it receives a HUP
# signal

# The file gives a list of devices to monitor using smartd, with one
# device per line. Text after a hash (#) is ignored, and you may use
# spaces and tabs for white space. You may use '\' to continue lines.

# The word DEVICESCAN will cause any remaining lines in this
# configuration file to be ignored: it tells smartd to scan for all
# ATA and SCSI devices.  DEVICESCAN may be followed by any of the
# Directives listed below, which will be applied to all devices that
# are found.  Most users should comment out DEVICESCAN and explicitly
# list the devices that they wish to monitor.
#DEVICESCAN

# Alternative setting to check the SMART health status of disks,
# send warning emails to root, check devices unless they are in SLEEP
# or STANDBY mode, with maximum number of skipped checks set to 12 hours.
DEVICESCAN -H -m root -n standby,24,q

# Alternative setting to ignore temperature and power-on hours reports
# in syslog.
#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9

# Alternative setting to report more useful raw temperature in syslog.
#DEVICESCAN -R 194 -R 231 -I 9

# Alternative setting to report raw temperature changes >= 5 Celsius
# and min/max temperatures.
#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9 -W 5

# First ATA/SATA or SCSI/SAS disk.  Monitor all attributes, enable

# Saturdays between 3-4am.
#/dev/sda -a -o on -S on -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)

# Monitor SMART status, ATA Error Log, Self-test log, and track
# changes in all attributes except for attribute 194
#/dev/sdb -H -l error -l selftest -t -I 194

# Monitor all attributes except normalized Temperature (usually 194),

#
# Sudo command interception:
#   Path intercept /path/to/sudo_intercept.so
#
# Path to a shared library containing replacements for the execv(),
# execve() and fexecve() library functions that perform a policy check
# to verify the command is allowed and simply return an error if not.
# This is used to implement the "intercept" functionality on systems that
# support LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent.
#
# The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed
# if you rename or move the sudo_intercept.so file.
#
#Path intercept /usr/lib64/sudo/sudo_intercept.so

#
# Sudo noexec:
#   Path noexec /path/to/sudo_noexec.so
#
# Path to a shared library containing replacements for the execv(),
# execve() and fexecve() library functions that just return an error.
# This is used to implement the "noexec" functionality on systems that
# support LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent.
#
# The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed
# if you rename or move the sudo_noexec.so file.
#
#Path noexec /usr/lib64/sudo/sudo_noexec.so

#
# Sudo plugin directory:
#   Path plugin_dir /path/to/plugins
#
# The default directory to use when searching for plugins that are
# specified without a fully qualified path name.
#
#Path plugin_dir /usr/lib64/sudo

#
# Core dumps:
#   Set disable_coredump true|false
#
# By default, sudo disables core dumps while it is executing (they
# are re-enabled for the command that is run).
# To aid in debugging sudo problems, you may wish to enable core
# dumps by setting "disable_coredump" to false.
#
#Set disable_coredump false

#
# User groups:
#   Set group_source static|dynamic|adaptive
#
# Sudo passes the user's group list to the policy plugin.
# If the user is a member of the maximum number of groups (usually 16),
# sudo will query the group database directly to be sure to include
# the full list of groups.
#
# On some systems, this can be expensive so the behavior is configurable.
# The "group_source" setting has three possible values:
#   static   - use the user's list of groups returned by the kernel.
#   dynamic  - query the group database to find the list of groups.
#   adaptive - if user is in less than the maximum number of groups.
#	       use the kernel list, else query the group database.
#
#Set group_source static

#
# Sudo interface probing:
#   Set probe_interfaces true|false
#
# By default, sudo will probe the system's network interfaces and
# pass the IP address of each enabled interface to the policy plugin.
# On systems with a large number of virtual interfaces this may take
# a noticeable amount of time.
#
#Set probe_interfaces false

#
# Sudo debug files:
#   Debug program /path/to/debug_log subsystem@priority[,subsyste@priority]
#
# Sudo and related programs support logging debug information to a file.
# The program is typically sudo, sudoers.so, sudoreplay, or visudo.
#
# Subsystems vary based on the program; "all" matches all subsystems.
# Priority may be crit, err, warn, notice, diag, info, trace, or debug.
# Multiple subsystem@priority may be specified, separated by a comma.
#
#Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@debug
#Debug sudoers.so /var/log/sudoers_debug all@debug
## sudoers file.
##
## This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
## Failure to use 'visudo' may result in syntax or file permission errors
## that prevent sudo from running.
##
## See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.

### Sample Wget initialization file .wgetrc
###

## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
## to find out what you can put into this file. You can find this here:
##   $ info wget.info 'Startup File'
## Or online here:
##   https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Startup-File
##
## Wget initialization file can reside in /etc/wgetrc
## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
##
## To use the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
## as well as change them, in most cases, as the values on the
## commented-out lines are the default values (e.g. "off").
##
## Command are case-, underscore- and minus-insensitive.
## For example ftp_proxy, ftp-proxy and ftpproxy are the same.


##
## Global settings (useful for setting up in /etc/wgetrc).
## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
##

# You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
# optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
# default quota is unlimited.
#quota = inf

# You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
# downloading a file (default is 20).
#tries = 20

# Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
# prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
# the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
#reclevel = 5

# By default Wget uses "passive FTP" transfer where the client
# initiates the data connection to the server rather than the other
# way around.  That is required on systems behind NAT where the client
# computer cannot be easily reached from the Internet.  However, some
# firewalls software explicitly supports active FTP and in fact has
# problems supporting passive transfer.  If you are in such
# environment, use "passive_ftp = off" to revert to active FTP.
#passive_ftp = off

# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
#waitretry = 10


##
## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
##
## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
## are doing before doing so.
##

# Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
#timestamping = off

# It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
# header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
# you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
#header = From: Your Name <username@site.domain>

# You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
# is *not* sent by default.
#header = Accept-Language: en

# You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http, https, and ftp.
# They will override the value in the environment.
#https_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
#ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

# If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
#use_proxy = on

# You can customize the retrieval outlook.  Valid options are default,
# binary, mega and micro.
#dot_style = default

# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
# the default!
#robots = on

# It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
# the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
#wait = 0

# You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
# retrieved, by setting this to on.
#dirstruct = off

# You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
# you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
#recursive = off

# To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
# to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),
# set this variable to on:
#backup_converted = off

# To have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default, set this
# to on:
#follow_ftp = off

# To try ipv6 addresses first:
#prefer-family = IPv6

# Set default IRI support state
#iri = off

# Force the default system encoding
#localencoding = UTF-8

# Force the default remote server encoding
#remoteencoding = UTF-8

# Turn on to prevent following non-HTTPS links when in recursive mode
#httpsonly = off

# Tune HTTPS security (auto, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, PFS)
#secureprotocol = auto
# whois configuration file
#
# This file can contain details of alternative whois servers to use if
# the compiled in servers are not suitable.  Each entry is a single
# text line and consists of a regular expression pattern to match and
# the whois server to be used for it, separated by blank space.
# IDN domains must use the ACE format.
#
# Eg:
# \.nz$ nz.whois-servers.net
#
# /etc/xattr.conf
#
# Format:
# <pattern> <action>
#
# Actions:
#   permissions - copy when trying to preserve permissions.
#   skip - do not copy.
#
# Note that libattr functions attr_copy_file() and attr_copy_fd() by default
# skip all extended attributes that are matched by any of the below patterns,
# regardless of the specified action.
